# Building for ANDROID

## Setting up the Android SDK Tools
- Go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html to download the most recent JDK.    Choose the one with the highest version number.
- Simply run the installer and follow instructions in the wizard to install it.

NEXT WE NEED TO INSTALL THE ANDROID SDK TOOLS
- Go to http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
- Download the Android SDK Tools or (the command line tools), not the full android studio just the command line tools
- Unzip the downloaded file, put the directory in an accessible location, youâ€™ll need to tell Unity where is this  directory later
- Open the directory that contains the Android SDK Tools, and navigate to tools. Double click the file called android to run it.
- Click Install [x] packages to start the installation process. You will be prompted to accept the licenses for these packages.
- The installation will take some time to complete.
## Now we will tell Unity where we installed the Android SDK Tools.
- Go to top menu, navigate to Unity > Preferences (on OSX) or Edit > Preferences (on Windows).
- In the Preferences window, navigate to External Tools, and scroll down to Android section.
- Where it says SDK, click Browse, navigate to where you put the directory containing Android SDK Tools and click Choose the path may look like this (C:/Users/[userName]/AppData/Local/Android/sdk).
- Where it says JDK, click Browse, navigate to where you put the directory containing JDK Tools and click Choose the path may look like this (C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_121).
## Finally, Preparing your Unity project for building to Android
 - In Unity, open the Build Settings from the top menu (File > Build Settings).
 - Select Android from the list of platforms on the left and choose Switch Platform at the bottom of the window.
 - Open the player settings in the inspector panel (Edit > Project Settings > Player).
 - Expand the section at the bottom called Other Settings, and enter your chosen Package Name where it says Package Name.
 - Now comeback open the Build Settings from the top menu (File > Build Settings), and click on Build.

 # Building for IOS
 
 Building for IOS is a long process, but Unity created a good Guide for building for IOS.
 - First, you should have a Mac and Xcode installed. If you don't have a mac install it on a Virtual Machine or rent an online server and install Xcode. Once you did that follow this Unity tutorial.
